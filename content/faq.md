### How Do I Get the Widget on my Website?

Under the Calendar tab you will see a link called Get Embed Code. Click on this link
and a popup will come up with a block of code. Copy the entire code block and paste it into the HTML
of your website where you want your widget to appear. We also offer free technical assistance
getting your widget embedded on your website if you are having problems getting it to look right.
Email <b>help@consultationkit.com</b> and we will be happy to get you all set up!
